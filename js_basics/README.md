`statically typed programming languages

              In statically typed programming languages, type checking occurs at compile time. 
              At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable format.
              This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known.
              Examples of languages include C, C++, Java, Swift, Haskell, Fortran

dynamically typed programming languages

              In dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time.
              This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing.
              Examples of programming languages are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl
